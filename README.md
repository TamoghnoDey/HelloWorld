Hi,Logan here
Been watching Naruto lately
Will be dumping some heavy quotes in here

“The longer you live… The more you realize that reality is just made of pain, suffering and emptiness.” 
“Rejection is a part of any man’s life. If you can’t accept and move past rejection, or at least use it as writing material – you’re not a real man.” 
“A place where someone still thinks about you is a place you can call home.” 
"Pain allows people to grow… and how you grow is up to you.” 
“Because they saved me from myself, they rescued me from my loneliness. They were the first to accept me for who I am. They’re my friends.” 
“While you’re alive, you need a reason for your existence. Being unable to find one is the same as being dead.” 
“Having too many bonds causes one to lose focus, weakening their strongest wish, their greatest desire.” 
“Those who forgive themselves, and are able to accept their true nature… They are the strong ones!” 
“We are humans, not fish. We don’t know what kind of people we truly are until the moment before our deaths. As death comes to embrace you, you will realize what you are. That’s what death is, don’t you think?” 
“No single thing is perfect by itself. That’s why we’re born to attract other things to make up for what we lack. I think we start walking in the right direction only after we start getting our counterparts beside us.” 
“Even innocent foolish children will grow up in the face of pain, until their thoughts and beliefs are the same as their doubts.” 
“We have walked through the darkness of this world, that’s why we are able to see even a sliver of light.”
“I could say I’m not sad, but I’d be lying. The problem is the world won’t let me stay a kid forever, so I can’t lie around crying about it either.”
“Laziness is the mother of all bad habits. But ultimately she is a mother and we should respect her.” 
“The difference between stupidity and genius, is that genius has its limits.”
